- [x] Introduce a prototype of a complete profile with the following:
    - Better CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS/RUSTFLAGS/GOFLAGS than the default
    - Unmasking and masking of correct packages & versions
    - **DONE** â€” See `features/stylize`
- [x] Introduce something like `ltoize` from the GentooLTO overlay, enhanced
    - Not sure whether to mark this as complete... `features/stylize` exists, but is less extensible compared to ltoize.  
    I decided to use a profile feature set for easier management from the repo maintainer's (me in this case) side, theoretically at least.
- [ ] Update main README (2023/08/25)
    - It's currently outdated, and way behind thing that were added over time.
