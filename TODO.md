### Documentation
- [x] README.md: Explain which ebuilds require the GURU overlay, check if at all.

### Sets
- [ ] Remove openwrt-prequisites; I am not a fan of installing software I'll use once.\
Nix is a better tool for this imo, see repo I made perfectly describing this: [coreboot-nix-workspace](https://github.com/kir68k/coreboot-nix-workspace)
- [ ] Decide whether to keep llvm-complete; it helped me once, but it was a very specific case.
