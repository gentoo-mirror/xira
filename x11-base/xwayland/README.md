# Info
These are modified versions of main repo ebuilds, introducing the famous [DPI scaling patch](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/733), with support for fractional scaling.  
The patch has been minimally modified from the original GitLab MR, as the `xwayland-screen.c` file has changed contents, giving hunk failures.
